# Event-Center-Website

For my Event Center Website, I chose to create a Website for the Church Camp I grew up attending. The site includes a hero image, a fully functional navigation bar, a welcome page with common questions, an events page to mark upcoming events, a schedule page to layout the schedule and dress code for camp, a location page to cover location details, a contact page to meet the team that makes camp possible, and a fully functional footer, all styled using a css style page.

The index page is designed to introduce this camp to the user. It welcomes the user in and answers common questions someone might have regarding this camp. The welcome page invites the user to explore and learn more about this camp.

The events page follows a fun design, displaying all the upcoming events related to camp. Each event gets its own graphic as well as a detailed section explaning the event and providing the location, date, and time.

The schedule page I used in place of the menu page. This camp doesn't have a traditional menu so I instead used tables to create a schedule for the days and a packing list of suggested items to bring as well as prohibited items. I also used the space to incorporate list detailing the rules of camp as well as the dress code. 

The location page is designed to show both the physical address of the camp with picture of the map view as well as some of the important locations on the campgrounds. The site includes hyperlinks to the address for both Apple Maps and Google Maps to create a user friendly and inclusive experience.

The contact page is fully fitted with a "Meet the Team" section used to introduce each of the key members who help make this camp run. There is a section dedicated to connecting the user with the official Facebook page for the camp with a hyperlink that takes the user directly to the page. There is also a form section where the user can ask any specific questions or inquiries simply by filling out the form with their name, number, email, and question. Lastly there is the emergeny contact information section for parents to utilize while their child is at camp, set with hyperlinks to call the number simply by clicking on it.
